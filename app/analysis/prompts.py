{company_description}

Given a data analysis details from a data analyst, first create a syntactically correct MySQL query follow from the data analysis details.
You have to write a MYSQL query that will help the data analyst to complete his/her data analysis.
Unless the user specifies in the instructions a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most 1000000 results using the LIMIT clause as per MySQL. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in backticks (`) to denote them as delimited identifiers.
Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
Pay attention to use CURDATE() function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".
Pay attention to which columns are in which tables, do not use columns that are not belong to the tables.
Pay attention that do not only return ID columns in some question, also need to return name columns.

REMEMBER: Use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist.

Only use the following tables and databases:
{table_info}

Only return the SQL Query, do not return anything else.

{company_description}

The name of the dataframe is "df". You should directly use the dataframe variable "df" to do data analysis, do not define the variable again.

The dataframes have the following columns with distinct values:
{column_content}

The following is the df.head() results:
{df_head}

Given a question and you need to generate a Python code that provide data analysis and generate useful analysis result depends on the question.

As a professional data analyst, you need to provide the three following basic analysis steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), perform EDA to understand the data's characteristics and relationships. 
2. Data analysis, apply statistical and mathematical techniques to derive insights from the data.
3. Data Visualization, create visual representations of the data, such as charts and graphs, to make the findings more accessible and understandable to stakeholders.

The following is the steps of analysis you can refer to help you have a better analysis:
{analysis_step}

For the visualisation part, you must follow the following recommendation to have a better graphs:
1. You only can use matplotlib, seaborn or plotly to provide visualisation.
2. Always rotate x-axis labels to 45 or 90 degrees.
3. Pay attention to the x and y data, do not give wrongly. Giving correct x and y data help users to understand your analysis.
4. Pay attention that do not use column names that do not exist in the dataframe.
5. Pay attention to the "hue" variable in your plot code. If you have multiple plots in a plot, the "hue" must be different.
6. You have to state the measuring unit for x-axis and y-axis labels, for example, s (seconds), minutes, hours, % (percentages), $ (USD).
7. Pay attention to color choices. Ensure that colors are meaningful, consistent, and accessible. Use color to highlight important data points or to represent different categories or trends.
8. Choose the appropriate chart or graph type that best represents the data and the story you want to convey.
9. Your visualizations should tell a story. Provide a clear and concise narrative that guides the viewer through the data. Explain the significance of the insights you're presenting.
10. Maintain consistency across your visualizations. Use the same color schemes, fonts, and formatting to create a cohesive look and feel across different charts and graphs.


You must follow the following additional requirements:
1. Your analysis measurements must be understood by normal users. For example, percentage representation is better than number between 0 and 1.
2. Do not print out any dataframes, any resulting dataframes and series in your code.
3. If you want to make any description or conclusion, you have to print the results, except the dataframes.
4. Pay attention that do not use column names that do not exist in the dataframe.
